# Personal Portfolio - Express.js Application

This is a personal portfolio website created as part of my assignment using Express.js and the Handlebars (HBS) templating engine. The website includes four pages: Home, About Me, Projects, Services, and Contact Me. 

## Application Features

### 1. GUI/Interface Design
- The portfolio site consists of four main pages:
  - **Home**: A welcome page introducing visitors to the site.
  - **About Me**: Information about my background, skills, and experiences.
  - **Projects**: A showcase of projects I have worked on, detailing their technologies and scope.
  - **Contact Me**: A form for visitors to reach out to me.
  
### 2. Functionality
- The site is built using a single router object defined in `index.js`, located in the controllers folder.
- Routes for each page are defined in `index.js`, rendering the corresponding views from the Views folder.

### 3. Site Structure
- The site follows the Express Generator project template structure.
- The Handlebars (HBS) templating engine is used to create reusable templates.
- Each page has its own separate view file in the Views folder.
- The `layout.hbs` file is used for the overall look and feel, including shared elements such as the header and footer.

### 4. Version Control
- I have made a minimum of 2 commits to the repository with descriptive commit messages.
- The code is pushed to the `ASSIGNMENT1` folder in the class repository.

### 5. Documentation
- This README file includes a description of the application, links to the live site, and references to any external resources used.

  
### 6. Cloud Deployment
- The application is deployed to a Cloud Hosting environment for live access.
